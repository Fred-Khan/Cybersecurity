# Hashcat Keyspace Definition
---
In Hashcat, the term **keyspace** refers to the total number of possible password candidates that will be tested during a cracking session. It essentially defines the scope of the attack by specifying the length and character set of the passwords being tested.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Character Set**: The set of characters that can be used in the passwords. This can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

2. **Password Length**: The length of the passwords being tested. For example, if you're testing passwords that are exactly 8 characters long, the keyspace will be calculated based on this length.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The keyspace is calculated by raising the number of characters in the character set to the power of the password length. For example, if you're using a character set of 26 lowercase letters and testing passwords of length 8, the keyspace would be \(26^8 = 208,827,064,576\).

4. **Mask Attack**: When using a mask attack, the keyspace is defined by the mask you provide. For example, a mask of `?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l` (where `?l` represents a lowercase letter) would have a keyspace of \(26^8 = 208,827,064,576\).

5. **Keyspace Command**: Hashcat provides a `--keyspace` option to display the keyspace for a given attack configuration. This helps you understand the size of the task before starting the attack.

Understanding keyspace is crucial for estimating the time and resources needed for a password cracking attempt. It helps in planning and optimising the attack strategy


### ðŸ”‘ Why Knowing the Keyspace Matters

1. **Estimating Runtime**
- The size of the keyspace, combined with your deviceâ€™s cracking speed (e.g. in MH/s or GH/s), gives you a ballpark estimate for how long an attack will take.
- Example:  
  If your keyspace is 208,827,064,576 and your system runs at 1,348 MH/s (i.e. 1.348 billion guesses/second), then:
  \[
  \text{Estimated Time} = \frac{208,827,064,576}{1,348,000,000} \approx 155 \text{ seconds} \approx 2.6 \text{ minutes}
  \]

2. **Choosing the Right Attack**
- A massive keyspace might steer you away from a full brute-force attack toward wordlists or rule-based attacks, which are more efficient.
- You might also optimize the mask (e.g. narrowing to `?l?l?l?l`) or use incremental lengths to cut down processing time.

3. **GPU/CPU Resource Planning**
- Knowing the expected duration helps manage heat, power usage, and load balancing if multiple sessions or devices are involved.
- You can schedule heavy workloads during off-hours or distribute keyspace across multiple GPUs or nodes in a cluster.

4. **RAM, Disk & Storage**
- While Hashcat doesn't preload the keyspace, certain optimizations (like large wordlists, rules, or potfile lookups) can require substantial memory. Knowing the keyspace helps estimate the demand curve.

5. **Feasibility of Exhaustive Cracks**
- If the keyspace exceeds trillions or quadrillions of combinations, even at high speeds, it might not be practical to exhaust it. Knowing that number helps set realistic expectationsâ€”or prove the importance of strong passwords in demonstrations.
